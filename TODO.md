Things to do:
* Add ability to set global javascript to be run on every page.
* Investigate why webfonts aren't working on gov.uk


Questions:
* Should we re-open the page when changing viewport? Else some kind of delay between viewport changes.
* Should sizes be sorted by width - largest to smallest (so websites that do smart things with image resolution give you the highest quality)?
